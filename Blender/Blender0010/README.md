# Project: Create Your Own Animated Solar System
## Overview
In this project, kids will create a simple model of the solar system in Blender, using Python scripts to automate the creation of planets, the sun, and animate their orbits. This project introduces basic concepts of astronomy, 3D modeling, and programming.

## Skills Developed
- Python Programming: Basic syntax, loops, functions, and Blender API usage.
- 3D Modeling: Understanding of basic 3D shapes, transformations, and animations in Blender.
- Astronomy Basics: Learning about the planets, their relative sizes, and orbits around the sun.

## Introduction to Blender and Python:
- Familiarize with Blender's interface.
- Introduction to Blender's Python API (bpy).

## Creating the Sun and Planets:
- Use Python to create spheres in Blender, varying sizes to represent the sun and each planet.
- Apply different materials or colors to each sphere to distinguish the planets.

## Setting Up Orbits
- Teach how to use Python to position the planets at different distances from the sun.
- Introduction to using empty objects as pivot points for orbiting.

## Animating the Planets

- Write Python scripts to animate the planets orbiting around the sun. The animation can be simplified to circular orbits.
- Adjust the speed of each planet's orbit based on their distance from the sun (not to scale but to keep the concept understandable).
- Adding Moons (Optional):

As an advanced step, add moons to planets like Earth, Mars, or Jupiter, and animate their orbits around their respective planets.

## Viewing and Sharing

- Teach how to render the animation into a video format.
- Share the project with family or friends, or even on a school website.
